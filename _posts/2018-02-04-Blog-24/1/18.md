    <td>Today, we started to create our own 'quizzes', you could say, by using the Python3 coding language on repl.it. To start the lesson off, our teacher showed us how he made a quiz using highly complex functions. We then set off to make our quizzes on a subject of our choice, my choice was ‘What Warhammer 40k faction are you most like?’. It was perfectly simple to make the program print the first question and the four answers that you could choose from. The logic for finding the answer at the end of the quiz would add up the score of each answer that was chosen for each question, and then come up with one of four results. But then I ran into a problem, I couldn’t get the score to add the score from any answer that was chosen, and I couldn’t find out what was wrong. So, next lesson, I plan to solve this problem and make my program work.</td>
